This lab will give you an opportunity to practice your skills solving problems with Strings.

Remember no matter what programming langugage you use, the following top level methods are available:
+ extract char from string at particular index
+ extract string substring
+ equality, length, to character array
+ sort, type convert from integer to string and vice versa

**Reverse words in a string**

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
For example, given s = "the grass is green", return "green is grass the".

**Length of Last Word**

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

**Isomorphic Strings**

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
For example,"egg" and "add" are isomorphic, "foo" and "bar" are not.

**String Palindrome**

A string is a palindrome if it remains unchanged when reversed, for example "dad" is a palindrome as reverse of "dad" is "dad" whereas "program" is not a palindrome. Some other palindrome strings are "mom", "civic", "madam".
